### **5.5. Feature: Enhanced Authentication & Authorization System**

*   **Description:** This feature will implement a financial-grade authentication and authorization system. It will incorporate FAPI-compliant OAuth 2.0 with PKCE and certificate-bound tokens, mandate hardware token-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical operations (supporting FIDO2/OATH), and establish a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system based on the principle of least privilege. Secure session management is also a key component.
*   **Priority:** Must-Have

#### **Key Requirements/User Stories:**

*   Implement FAPI-compliant OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE and support for certificate-bound tokens.
*   Deploy hardware token-based MFA (FIDO2, OATH standards) for all trading operations and administrative access.
*   Create a comprehensive RBAC system allowing definition of roles, granular permissions, and user assignments to enforce the principle of least privilege.
*   Ensure secure session management including creation, validation, expiration, and invalidation.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Successful implementation of FAPI-compliant OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, verifiable via compliance tools.
*   Support for certificate-bound tokens, cryptographically tied to client's TLS certificate.
*   Hardware token-based MFA (FIDO2 and/or OATH) successfully integrated and enforced for trading and admin access.
*   RBAC system allows creation of custom roles and assignment of granular permissions.
*   RBAC effectively restricts user access based on assigned roles (principle of least privilege).
*   Secure session management (creation, validation, expiration, invalidation upon logout/inactivity).
*   All auth/authz processes are auditable with logs for compliance.
*   Resilience to common attacks (brute-force, session hijacking, privilege escalation) demonstrated via security testing.
*   Compliance with relevant financial regulations (e.g., PSD2, FFIEC) for auth/access control.

    *   **Structured Logging:** Logs will be in a structured format (e.g., JSON) for easier parsing, searching, and analysis.
    *   **Audit Logs:** Immutable and detailed audit trails for all sensitive operations (logins, financial transactions, administrative changes, key management operations, policy changes).
*   **Tracing:**
    *   **Distributed Tracing:** Implement distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin) to track requests across microservices, helping to identify bottlenecks and debug issues in complex flows.
*   **Alerting:**
    *   **Real-time Alerts:** Configure alerts for critical events:
        *   Security incidents (e.g., high failed login attempts, unauthorized access, SIEM alerts).
        *   Performance degradation (e.g., high latency, error rates exceeding thresholds).
        *   System outages or unavailability of critical components.
        *   Compliance breaches or anomalies (e.g., circuit breaker activations, high-risk transactions).
    *   **Notification Channels:** Alerts routed to appropriate teams via multiple channels (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack, email).
*   **Dashboards:**
    *   Utilize tools like Grafana to create comprehensive dashboards for visualizing metrics and system health, tailored for different stakeholders (Ops, Dev, Security, Compliance).

This strategy will ensure proactive identification of issues, rapid response to incidents, and continuous improvement of the platform.

## **13. Open Questions & Areas for Swarm Research (From Blueprint)**

These questions require further investigation by the AI Agent Swarm and relevant human experts to finalize design decisions:

1.  **HSM Integration Architecture:** What is the optimal HSM integration architecture that balances the stringent security requirements of FIPS 140-2 Level 3 with the ultra-low latency constraints essential for high-frequency DeFi trading operations? Consider co-location, API call overhead, and batching strategies.
2.  **MEV Protection Strategies:** Which private mempool providers (e.g., Flashbots, Eden Network, bloXroute) and MEV protection strategies (e.g., direct builder submission, specific auction mechanisms) offer the most effective defense against sandwich attacks and other front-running tactics while maintaining competitive arbitrage opportunities for legitimate users?
3.  **AML/KYC Framework Architecture for Hybrid Operations:** How should the AML/KYC compliance framework be architected to effectively support both centralized compliance monitoring (for institutional interfaces) and potentially decentralized aspects of trading operations across multiple jurisdictions with varying regulatory nuances?
4.  **Scalable Real-Time Transaction Monitoring:** What is the most cost-effective and technically scalable approach to implementing real-time transaction monitoring that can reliably process 50,000+ transactions per hour and generate alerts for complex suspicious patterns within sub-second latency (target ≤ 100 ms)? Evaluate build vs. buy for the core detection engine.
5.  **Optimizing Python Async for HSM Operations:** How can the existing Python asynchronous architecture (likely asyncio-based) be optimized to integrate HSM signing operations (which can sometimes be blocking or have higher latency) without introducing unacceptable delays in critical trading paths?
6.  **Effective SIEM Integration Patterns:** What specific SIEM integration patterns, log correlation rules, and behavioral analytics models are most effective for detecting sophisticated financial trading anomalies (e.g., market manipulation, advanced wash trading) while minimizing false positive rates in a high-volume environment?
7.  **Disaster Recovery in a Decentralized Context:** How should the disaster recovery and business continuity framework be designed to meet stringent regulatory uptime and data recovery requirements (RPO/RTO) while respecting and leveraging the decentralized nature of DeFi operations where applicable?

This Master Project Plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for the DEX-Core-Engine Security & Compliance Hardening Initiative. It will be a living document, updated as research progresses and implementation details are refined.
