A modular and production-ready framework for a simple Ethereum trading bot that operates exclusively on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). This project is built with a strong emphasis on Python best practices, security, and extensibility.

The default strategy implements a simple arbitrage mechanism, monitoring prices between two Uniswap V2-compatible DEXs (e.g., Uniswap and Sushiswap) and identifying profitable trading opportunities.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Modular Architecture**: 
The code is logically separated into components for configuration, blockchain interaction, DEX handling, and trading strategy. 
This follows the **Single Responsibility Principle**, making the codebase easy to understand, test, and maintain.
* **Arbitrage Strategy**: A simple, functional arbitrage strategy that monitors a token pair (WETH/DAI by default) across two DEXs.
* **Secure by Design**: Manages sensitive data like private keys and RPC URLs through environment variables, preventing credentials from being hardcoded in source code.
* **Robust Error Handling**: Implements specific exception handling for network issues and failed transactions, ensuring the bot operates reliably.
* **Extensible Framework**: The decoupled design allows developers to easily implement and plug in new, more complex trading strategies without modifying the core boilerplate.
* **Adherence to Best Practices**: Built from the ground up following industry-standard Python best practices, including PEP 8 compliance, comprehensive typing, and clear documentation.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The bot is designed with a clean separation of concerns, ensuring that each part of the application has a distinct and focused purpose.

  /‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env # Local environment configuration (private)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py # Loads and validates configuration from .env
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web3_service.py # Service layer for all web3.py blockchain interactions
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dex_handler.py # Abstraction for interacting with DEX router contracts
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ strategy.py # Contains the trading logic (e.g., ArbitrageStrategy)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py # Main entry point for the application
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt # Project dependencies


1. **`config.py`**: Loads all required parameters (keys, addresses, thresholds) from the `.env` file. 

2. **`web3_service.py`**: A service class that encapsulates all `web3.py` logic. It handles node connections, transaction signing, and sending. 

3. **`dex_handler.py`**: Provides a high-level interface for DEX interactions, such as querying token prices and executing swaps. 

4. **`strategy.py`**: Implements the actual trading logic. It uses the `DEXHandler` to get market data and act on it. 

5. **`main.py`**: The application's entry point. It initializes all objects and starts the strategy's main loop. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack * 
**Python 3.9+** * 
**[web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py)**: The primary library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. * 
**[python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)**: For managing environment variables. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup 
Follow these steps to get your trading bot up and running. 

### 1. Prerequisites 
* Python 3.9 or newer. 
* An Ethereum wallet with a small amount of ETH for gas fees. 
* An RPC URL from a node provider like [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/). 

### 2. Clone the Repository 

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd python-dex-trading-bot
```

3. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies in isolation.

# Create and activate a virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
# Install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
4. Configure Environment Variables
   
Create a .env file in the project's root directory. You can copy the .env.example file if it exists, or create one from scratch.

üîí IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE The PRIVATE_KEY grants full control over your wallet.
‚Ä¢ Never share this key or commit the .env file to version control.
‚Ä¢ It is highly recommended to use a new, dedicated "hot wallet" for this bot with a limited amount of funds.
Your .env file should look like this:
```
# Ethereum Node RPC URL from a provider like Infura or Alchemy RPC_URL="YOUR_RPC_URL_HERE" 
# Wallet credentials 
# WARNING: This is your private key. Keep it secret, keep it safe. PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE" WALLET_ADDRESS="YOUR_WALLET_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_HERE"
```

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
To run the bot, execute the main.py script from the root of the project directory:

python main.py

The bot will initialize and begin polling the configured DEXs for trading opportunities. The console will display the current prices and whether a profitable opportunity has been found.
Example Output:
```
Initializing Ethereum Trading Bot... 
Connected to Ethereum node. 
Wallet: 0x... 
DEX handlers initialized. 
--- Starting Arbitrage Trading Bot --- 
Monitoring WETH / DAI pair. 
DEX 1 Router: 0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D 
DEX 2 Router: 0xd9e1cE17f2641f24aE83637ab66a2cca9C378B9F ---------------------------------------- 
Price DEX1: 3450.12 DAI | Price DEX2: 3451.50 DAI | Margin: 1.38 DAI 
No profitable opportunity found. Standing by. Waiting for 10 seconds...
```

üß© How to Extend the Bot
The modular design makes it easy to add new strategies. To create your own:
‚Ä¢ Create a new class in strategy.py (e.g., MovingAverageStrategy).
‚Ä¢ Ensure it has a run() method that contains the main logic loop.
‚Ä¢ In main.py, instantiate your new strategy class instead of ArbitrageStrategy.
This design promotes low coupling between the strategy logic and the underlying blockchain services.
